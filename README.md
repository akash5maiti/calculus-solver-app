# Calculus Solver App

A Python application using Tkinter for solving calculus problems, including differentiation and integration. This app allows users to input mathematical expressions and variables, select the operation, and view the results with detailed steps.

## Features

- **Differentiation**: Compute the derivative of a given expression with respect to a specified variable.
- **Integration**: Compute the integral of a given expression with respect to a specified variable.
- **Detailed Steps**: View step-by-step results of the calculations.

## Installation
